\newthought{John Dewey}, probably the most influential of all American philosophers, was born 
in Vermont in 1859. After graduation from the University of Vermont, he received a 
Ph.D. from The Johns Hopkins University and taught at a number of major universities, 
including the University of Chicago and Columbia. Before his death in 1952 he bad 
gained an international reputation for his pragmatic approach to philosophy, psychology, 
and liberal politics.

Among his important books in these areas are: How We Think (1910), Reconstruction 
in Philosophy (1920), Experience and Nature (1925), and Logic The Theory of inquiry 
(1938). The commission, which he headed, that investigated the Moscow trials of 1936- 
37 is not example of the practical approach to political action which characterized him 
throughout his life and made him a controversial figure among liberals (though 
universally condemned by Communists). 

In all likelihood, Dewey's most enduring influence is in the field of education. 
Believing in the unity of theory and practice, Dewey not only wrote on the subject, but 
for a time participated in the "laboratory school" for children connected with the 
University of Chicago. His chief early work in this field, Democracy and Education 
(1916), was the most comprehensive statement of his position. The present work, written 
more than two decades later, shows how Dewey reformulated his ideas as a result of the 
intervening experience of the progressive schools and in the light of the criticisms his 
theories had received. Consequently, it represents the best concise statement on education 
by the most important educational theorist of the twentieth century. Moreover, it is 
probably the simplest and most readable extended statement on this subject that Dewey 
ever made.
